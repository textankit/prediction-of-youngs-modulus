**Tittle: Prediction of young's modulus using Regression model**

Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
Created Neural Architecture in Python for prediction of Young's Modulus, worked with complex Data Sets., applied advanced analytical methods as needed.
Used TensorFlow, Keras, and Pandas in building the ANN model. Achieved a prediction accuracy of 80%
